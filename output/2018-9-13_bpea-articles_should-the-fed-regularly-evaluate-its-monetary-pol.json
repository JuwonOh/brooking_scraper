  "content": "\nAbstract\nWould a more open and regular evaluation of the monetary policy framework improve policy in the United States? Even when considering a relatively short timeframe spanning the 1960s to present, it is possible to point to many significant changes to the framework. Some of the changes were precipitated by acute economic conditions, others were considered and implemented only gradually as a response to long-standing problems with the framework. But the process for evaluating and changing frameworks to date has not always been transparent, and changes have not always been timely. Could a more formal, and open, review improve how well we adhere to our current framework? Could transitions to a new framework be made more effectively? We conclude that such a review might indeed be beneficial, and outline one possible review process.\nCitations\nFuhrer, Jeffrey, Giovanni Olivei, Eric Rosengren, and Geoffrey Tootell. 2018. “Should the Fed Regularly Evaluate its Monetary Policy Framework?” BPEA Conference Draft, Fall.\nConflict of Interest Disclosure\nThe authors are officers and employees of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
