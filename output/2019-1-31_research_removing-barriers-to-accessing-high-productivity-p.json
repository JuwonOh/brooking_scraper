  "content": "\nThe Problem\nHistorically, Americans have moved to the parts of the country that offered the highest wages and most economic opportunity. However, this dynamic has faltered in recent decades, as land-use restrictions have limited housing availability in America’s booming local economies. These regulatory constraints have shut millions of Americans out of the country’s most-productive labor markets.\nThe Proposal\nThe author proposes local land-use reforms to allow for an expanded stock of housing. Shoag also calls for state and federal action to promote pro-development policies. In particular, states should establish by-right development policies and federal policymakers should provide incentives to encourage local innovation in expanding access to housing.\n \n \nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Shoag\nAssociate Professor - Harvard Kennedy School Visiting Associate Professor - Case Western Reserve University\n\n\n\n\n"
